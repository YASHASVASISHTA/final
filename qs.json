{
"id": 1,
"subject": "Physics",
"topic": "Kinematics",
"questionText": "A particle starts from rest and accelerates at 2 m/s². What will be its velocity after 5 seconds?",
"options": [
"5 m/s",
"10 m/s",
"2.5 m/s",
"20 m/s"
],
"correctAnswer": 1,
"marks": 4,
"negativeMarks": 1,
"solution": "Solution: We use the first equation of motion: v = u + at.<br>Given: Initial velocity (u) = 0 m/s (starts from rest).<br>Acceleration (a) = 2 m/s².<br>Time (t) = 5 s.<br>Substituting the values: v = 0 + (2 * 5) = 10 m/s.<br>Therefore, the final velocity is 10 m/s."

"subject": "Physics",
"topic": "Laws of Motion",
"questionText": "According to Newton's second law of motion, force is equal to:",
"options": [
"Mass times velocity",
"Mass times acceleration",
"Work divided by time",
"Mass times displacement"
],
"correctAnswer": 1,
"marks": 4,
"negativeMarks": 1,
"solution": "Solution: Newton's Second Law of Motion states that the force (F) acting on an object is equal to the mass (m) of the object multiplied by its acceleration (a).<br>The formula is F = ma.<br>This directly corresponds to 'Mass times acceleration'."

"questionText": "What is the kinetic energy of a 4 kg object moving at a speed of 5 m/s?",
"options": [
"20 Joules",
"40 Joules",
"50 Joules",
"100 Joules"
],
"correctAnswer": 2,
"marks": 4,
"negativeMarks": 1,
"solution": "Solution: The formula for kinetic energy (KE) is KE = 0.5 * m * v².<br>Given: Mass (m) = 4 kg.<br>Velocity (v) = 5 m/s.<br>Substituting the values: KE = 0.5 * 4 * (5 * 5) = 2 * 25 = 50 Joules.<br>Thus, the kinetic energy is 50 Joules."

"2.4Ω",
"10Ω",
"24Ω",
"0.41Ω"
],
"correctAnswer": 1,
"marks": 4,
"negativeMarks": 1,
"solution": "Solution: When resistors are connected in series, the equivalent resistance (Req) is the sum of the individual resistances.<br>Given: R1 = 6Ω, R2 = 4Ω.<br>Formula: Req = R1 + R2.<br>Substituting the values: Req = 6 + 4 = 10Ω.<br>The equivalent resistance is 10Ω."
